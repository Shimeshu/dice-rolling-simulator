ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project is a simple Dice Rolling Simulation written in Python Programming
Language.

In this game, you have to guess the dice number. If your guess is equal to
the dice number, then you'll win, otherwise you'll lose.

The player has a maximum of 3 chances to play the game.

Note: This program is case-sensitive. Make sure to enter the commands
correctly.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

If you are running this source code, then you must have python 3.5 or above
installed on your PC. If you haven't, then please use the compiled version
of this project which is available as a zip file in my another repository.

Note: The zip file is only for Windows Users. Python 3.x is already pre-
installed in Linux Distributions.

Thank you for viewing the project. :)
